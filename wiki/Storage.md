# Storage

Idealy, Shisho can be designed to work with any storage adapter. Media could be stored locally on disk, in a cloud storage bucket, or a NAS drive.

The database will exist in a single place in the cloud, but the media content itself can be stored in different locations. Will require a bulk action to move media as needed.
